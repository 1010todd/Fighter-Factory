# Fighter Factory
 Plugin for Endless Sky that allow (some) fighter to be rebuilt to replace lost fighter.

To use buy "XMA03 Fighter Assembler" from an outfitter, buy Universal fighter parts and buy the blueprint for the fighter you want, depart and land then head to the job board to memorize your current number of fighter. Now when a fighter is lost the fighter assembler will build a new fighter for you upon landing.

Should work on 0.9.16.1+
