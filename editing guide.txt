Small guide to explain a bit about how to edit this plugin 
to maybe increase number of fighter produced a day or something

This will assume you have some basic knowledge about ES Data
if not, see https://github.com/endless-sky/endless-sky/wiki
Tip: If stuffs doesn't appear/work, check error.txt first.
Tip2: Turn on Word Warp if a line is too long. (Often in View -> Word Warp)

For editing custom fighter, see ffcustomfighter.txt inside data folder.

===How the plugin works===
For v0.9.16.1

In the backend it's basically an invisible mission that offer 
on landing if you met the requirement (have factory and 
one of the blueprint). Nothing complicated, just repetitive and tedious.

The main stuffs are in ffproduction.txt.

First, fighter/drone number logging. It is put in the job board to be the least intrusive since it's the only place you can visit for a list of option
that didn't just pop in your face and potentially blocking other mission 
if done repeatedly (FW intros do get blocked a lot because it have minor 
which means it won't offer if anything else offers at the same time). 
Mechanically this is simply just copying current number of fighters and 
drone (via "ship: Fighter" and "ship: Drone" condition) into a new condition 
(condition is basically a variable).

See https://github.com/endless-sky/endless-sky/wiki/Player-Conditions for all condition you can use.

After number of drones and fighter is logged next time when you land mission checks for a few things as offer condition: Factory outfit, blueprint outfit, parts outfit, and if current number of fighter or drone is less than memorized earlier. If all is yes then the mission is offered and during offering it give the appropriate ship.


`require` is technically part of what check if this mission can offer but 
for some weird code reason it's under `on offer` instead.

The `on accept` with `fail` under it is just some clean up so it 
doesn't stay active and bloat the save file.

mission "FiFc: Fighter Assembly (Lance) 1"
	invisible
	landing
	repeat
	to offer
		"ships: Fighter" < "FiFc: Mem: Fighter Count"
	on offer
		require "XMA03 Fighter Assembler" 1
		require "E1-a Lance Blueprint" 1
		outfit "Universal Fighter Parts" -1
		give ship "Lance"
	on accept
		fail
		
If you want to make two ship each landing just duplicate the 
`give ship "Lance"` line 
(and increase consumption of Parts if you want to be fair).

If you want to allow more Fighter Assembler to stack you'll have to 
duplicate the entire mission block (and give it different name, which is 
just swapping 1 to other number). Increase the number of Fighter Assembler 
and Blueprint required then you're done, for one ship, repeat that for the 
rest of the ships. If you're doing alot just write a script to duplicate 
the missions or get one from here: 
https://github.com/1010todd/ES-Content-Creation-Tools

Similarly if you want it to be able to build more fighter model then you 
do similar to above but edit the model name instead and create blueprint 
outfit for it simply by duplicating the blueprint outfit in ffoutfit.txt 
replace the name just like before and put the new blueprint in outfitters.

For 0.10.0

v0.10.0 have new autocondition stuffs which is more granular and more readable than `require` stuffs. It basically do the same thing as above.

mission "FiFc: Fighter Assembly (Custom Fighter 1) 1 v0.10.0"
	invisible
	landing
	repeat
	to offer
		"ships: Fighter" < "FiFc: Mem: Fighter Count"
		"outfit (installed): XMA03 Fighter Assembler" >= 1
		"outfit (installed): E1-a Custom Blueprint 1" >= 1
	on offer
		outfit "Universal Fighter Parts" -1
		give ship "FiFc: Custom Fighter 1"
	on accept
		fail
